Hi,

The only part that was GPL code from elsewhere was the bounding sphere computation.  You can keep 
it from being used by changing the #if 1 to an #if 0 in Trimesh_bounding.cc

For the rest, I hereby grant both of you the right to use it in commercial products.  I would appreciate 
any modifications, but that's not required.
